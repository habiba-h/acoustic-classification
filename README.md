# Acoustic classification
Acoustic Classification is one of the most widely used applications in Audio Deep Learning. It involves learning to classify sounds and to predict the category of that sound. This type of problem can be applied to many practical scenarios e.g. classifying music clips to identify the genre of the music, or classifying short utterances by a set of speakers to identify the speaker based on the voice.
